This example shows basic code that subscribes for updates to a tick instance. One way to try it out is to start the `tick_sub` application while running the [Enterprise Components](https://github.com/exxeleron/enterprise-components) [Lesson01](https://github.com/exxeleron/enterprise-components/tree/develop/tutorial/Lesson01) system on the same machine.
